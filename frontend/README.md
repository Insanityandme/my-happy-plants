# Introduction
This is the frontend part of MyHappyPlants, it is written in React and acts as a replacement of the JavaFX 
portion of the legacy project we worked on for six weeks our second year of university. 

# Install
1. ```git clone https://github.com/Insanityandme/systemutv-II-frontend.git```
2. Download and install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current
3. ```cd``` into systemutv-II-frontend
4. run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies
5. run ```npm start```
6. The server should now be running at localhost:3000!

# Testing
NOTE: There are two ways to run our tests: By running each file or through the command line

1. Editor: Go into src/Tests and run each file
2. Command line: ```npm test```
3. Press a to run all tests
4. Done!
5. Sometimes ```npm test``` does not run all 7 test suites, simply rerun and it should catch them all!

# Contact
